# Markdown Previewer

## Usage

You can play with the application yourself at [this link](https://bju12290.github.io/markdown-previewer/). 

This application simply translates markdown in the editor to the appropriate HTML, and renders it to the Preview section.


## Technologies Used
 - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A build tool that offers fast development and optimized production builds for modern web applications.
 - [React](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of dynamic and interactive components.
 - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): A front-end framework that provides pre-designed UI components and responsive layout utilities.
 - [Marked](https://marked.js.org/): A JavaScript Library used to parse and render Markdown content into HTML.
 - [Marked-React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked-react): A JavaScript Library that uses Marked to render actual React Elements instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

 ## Project Structure
- **'src/'**: At the heart of the application, the **'src/'** directory houses various project assets, the **index.jsx** file for routing, the **App.jsx** componenthigh-level structure definition, and the **index.css** file for application-wide styling.
   - **'components/'** : This directory serves as a container for reusable components that are used throughout the application. In this example both the Editor and Previewer are their on components and both housed in their own folders in the **'components/'** folder. Each component in the **'components/'** folder is housed alongside it's CSS-Styling for simplicity.
